# 🏦 Bank Loan Portfolio Analytics & Risk Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **bank loan portfolio analytics solution** designed to monitor lending performance, evaluate credit risk, and support data-driven decision-making.

It simulates a real-world banking use case where loan applications, disbursements, repayments, and borrower risk indicators are analyzed using KPIs and interactive dashboards.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Banks need continuous visibility into their loan portfolios to:
- Monitor loan growth and repayment trends
- Assess portfolio health and credit risk
- Identify non-performing loans early
- Support strategic and operational lending decisions

This project transforms raw loan data into **actionable insights** that help stakeholders understand portfolio performance and risk exposure.

---

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The analysis focuses on the following KPIs:

- **Total Loan Applications** (MTD & MoM)
- **Total Funded Amount** (MTD & MoM)
- **Total Amount Received**
- **Average Interest Rate**
- **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**

These KPIs provide a comprehensive view of lending activity, cash flow, pricing, and borrower risk.

## ⚖️ Good Loan vs Bad Loan Analysis
To evaluate portfolio quality, loans are classified as:

### ✅ Good Loans
- Loan Status: *Fully Paid*, *Current*
- Represent performing and healthy loans

### ❌ Bad Loans
- Loan Status: *Charged Off*
- Represent non-performing loans and credit risk

This classification helps identify risk concentration and supports portfolio-level risk assessment.
